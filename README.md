## Step 1:
	 Check for .csv files in the local directory

## Step 2:
	Enter the file number for your dataset in the current directory.

## Step 3:
	Select the target datapoints that will be compared with all the datapoints in the dataset.

## Step 4:
	Enter the class name for the predicted column.

## Step 5:
	Display the graph and show the datapoints of our target as well as the datapoints inside the dataset.

## Step 6:
		Calculate the Minkowski distances between the new datapoints and each other point.

## Step 7:
	Identify which points have the nearest Minkowski distance to the new point, and use them to predict the class of the new point.
